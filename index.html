          <h3>The Beginning</h3>
          <h4>The Life of Xander</h4>
          <p>
            Once upon a time, the was a woman who lived out in the forest where the trees were thick and the animals ran wild.  After nine months of waiting, she welcomed into the world a baby boy.  After one look, she decided that he shall be called Xander.
          </p>
          <p>
            His early years were spent running rampant amongst the animals. He learned how to jump and climb the trees with the monkeys.  His time with the jaguars taught him how to hunt and the giant otters taught him how to swim.  It was a great childhood.  His mom was proud of him.

        <h3>The Middle</h3>
        <p>
            Xander's life changed when he was running through the forest one day. He was jumping around with his monkey friends when out of the corner of his eye, he saw a new plant that he immediately wanted to eat. The plant was beautiful and very tasty, and he ate as many as he could until he was full. However, thirty minutes later it felt like Xander was floating among the stars that he saw at night, and was one with the Earth.
        </p>
        <p>
            Xander ran as fast and long as he could as it felt like he was a spaceship flying through the galaxy. Xander flew all the way to the beach, where a group of conquistadors found him and were amused by him. They decided to take him with them as their jester and he entertained them for many years.

          <h3>The Other Middle</h3>
          <p>
              Xander had a wonderful life working as a jester for his new Spanish friends. He travelled to strange, far away places and was able to make the native people's he encountered share the joy of laughter. One day Xander arrived at a place called Boulder. There he met strange people with long pieces of wood strapped to their feet. They rode their logs down tall mountains covered in a strange white powder.
          </p>
          <p>
            One day he met a man atop one of these mountains who he entertained with his miming and dancing. The man was grateful to meet the young Xander and offered him a glass dish filled with strange green and purple herbs. Xander took a deep breath and watched as the contents of the pot turned to black.

          <p class="para">
            Before he knew it, Xander was in no mood to dance and entertain as a jester. Instead, he wanted one thing, a sandwich and Cheetos. He transported his new findings to the conquistadors, who then had their go with the mysterious new green.
          </p >
          <p class="para">
            As a whole, Xander the jester and his friends slithered throughout the brick roads of Boulder until coming upon a small market. In this market, a short peasent offered them a bag of Cheetos, a sandwich named "Brandon", and small tabs for all.
          </p>
          <p class="para">
            With such a great deal, the clan took the offer, and soon consumed it all, including the strange paper tabs. Soon before they reached their quarters for the night, the road began to walk with them.

            Their journey was like none other. It was full of colors, light, and discovery.  They watched Planet Earth until they all fell asleep.  When they woke up the next morning, they felt as if their friendship was eternal.

          <h3>Almost The End</h3>
          <p>
            After they had gathered their senses, Xander and his friends realized they had all become animals. They must have watched too much Planet Earth and transformed into their spirit animals. Xander was of course an orangutan because of his time spent in the jungle. He scratched his head and wondered how things could get any better. Xander had always missed his old life after moving to a civilized world, and it felt like the good old days.

          <h3>Getting Closer</h3>
          <p>
            Xander grew very wise as he grew in age. As he became wiser, he began to change into his final form, a handsome green fella. He understood that an orangutan was only the beginning of his life peak. As he passed on his knowledge throughout the jungle he became old and weary. His head began to turn into that of a raisin, and his brain could be mistaken as sausage. His time was near.

            The narrator has become confused about the nature of this story but maybe that is the moral of our story. Young Xander never knew the true nature of his being and neither do we. All we know for sure is that Xander is a drug addict.
