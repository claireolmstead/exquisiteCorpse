          <h3>The Beginning</h3>
          <h4>The Life of Xander</h4>
          <p>
            Once upon a time, the was a woman who lived out in the forest where the trees were thick and the animals ran wild.  After nine months of waiting, she welcomed into the world a baby boy.  After one look, she decided that he shall be called Xander.
          </p>
          <p>
            His early years were spent running rampant amongst the animals. He learned how to jump and climb the trees with the monkeys.  His time with the jaguars taught him how to hunt and the giant otters taught him how to swim.  It was a great childhood.  His mom was proud of him.

          <h3>The Middle</h3>
          <p>
              Xander's life changed when he was running through the forest one day. He was jumping around with his monkey friends when out of the corner of his eye, he saw a new plant that he immediately wanted to eat. The plant was beautiful and very tasty, and he ate as many as he could until he was full. However, thirty minutes later it felt like Xander was floating among the stars that he saw at night, and was one with the Earth.
          </p>
          <p>
              Xander ran as fast and long as he could as it felt like he was a spaceship flying through the galaxy. Xander flew all the way to the beach, where a group of conquistadors found him and were amused by him. They decided to take him with them as their jester and he entertained them for many years.

          <h3>The Other Middle</h3>
          <p>
              Xander had a wonderful life working as a jester for his new Spanish friends. He travelled to far away, strange places and was able to make the native people's he encountered share the joy of laughter. One day Xander arrived in a far away land known as Wuhan, China. Xander ran around the city excited to entertain the new people he met. He ran to groups of people wearing strange masks and did a little jig which made them laugh. After he would embrace each and every one of them. Many we're eating and drinking foods that he had never seen before and he eagerly tried the foods that were half eaten on their plates.
          </p>
          <p>
              However, on his last day in Wuhan as he was boarding his ship with the conquistadors he noticed he had severe respiratory problems and a heightened fever...
